# To run the front end

`npm install`
`npm start`

open http://localhost:3000/

Runs the app from http://localhost:3000

Note the following:
* You will also need the unified-api running (expected on port 8080).
* You will need to open the app in a CORS-disabled browser
* When you first click "Click Me", you will need to wait a significant amount of time for the request
to finish and the map to be updated. There are no loading spinners to indicate this.
* The date range picker is broken so the app should be used for demonstration purposes only.
